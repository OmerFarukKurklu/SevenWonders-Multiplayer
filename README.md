This project is conducting as term project for CS-319 course in Bilkent University.

We are group of 5  students from Computer Science Department:
Umur Göğebakan, Ömer Faruk Kürklü, Akın Parkan, Alptekin Önder, Elif Kasapoğlu.

In our project, we will implement a board game namely '7 Wonders'.

This game will be implemented by using Java language.

## 7 Wonders
7 Wonders  is a card game which you are tasked with building up your civilization through a series of 3 ages (rounds). Your civilization is built by playing cards every round to your play area. 

This game can be played by 3-7 players.
### Objective of the game
A game of 7 Wonders takes place over 3 Ages, each using one of the 3 card decks (first the Age I cards, then Age II, and finally Age III). These Ages are each played similarly, with each player having the opportunity to play 6 cards per Age to develop his or her city and build their Wonder.

At the end of each Age, each player compares their military might with their two neighboring cities (belonging to the players to their right and left).

At the end of the third Age, the players count their victory points; the player with the most points wins the game.
